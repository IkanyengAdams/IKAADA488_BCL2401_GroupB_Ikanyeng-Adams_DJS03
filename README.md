# DJS03 Project Brief: Book Connect - Abstractions

- I used functions that are meaningful in order for any programmer to understand, I also used comments for more clarity
  
- Abstraction helps with a more readable and mantainable code, I wrapped similar code together in a single function and gave it meaningful names.
  
- The biggest challenge I faced was having to group similar code into the correct function, there was also duplicates on my code however I managed to notice and got rid of the code duplicates
  
- In terms of Object Oriented Programming, I now have some understanding of how abstraction works.
